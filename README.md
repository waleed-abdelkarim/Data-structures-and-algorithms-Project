# Data-structures-and-algorithms-Project

## 1 Introduction:

Vehicle hiring companies such as Uber, Careem, and Jeeny rely on fast localization of available vehicles near potential
customers. Such efficient localization requires specialized data structures, and the goal of this project is to implement
and use one such data structure.


## 2 Storing vehicles locations:

Vehicles and customers are localized using GPS devices available in mobile phones, and these devices determine
the longitude and latitude coordinates as floating-point numbers. To simplify the task, however, we will divide the
geographical area under consideration into small cells and use integers to identify each location on the map.
